Sailon is for use during the development of a sails app.  It is much like sailon for sails.js.

Sailon watch the files in the directory in which sailon was started, and if any files change, sailon will automatically restart your sails application.

sailon does **not** require *any* changes to your code or method of development. sailon simply wraps your sails application and keeps an eye on any files that have changed. Remember that sailon is a replacement wrapper for `sails`, think of it as replacing the word "sails" on the command line when you run your script.

# Installation

Either through forking or by using [npm](http://npmjs.org) (the recommended way):

    npm install -g sailon

And sailon will be installed in to your bin path. Note that as of npm v1, you must explicitly tell npm to install globally as sailon is a command line utility.

# Usage

sailon wraps around sails, so you can pass all the arguments you would normally pass to sails:

    sailon [your sails command]

For CLI options, use the `-h` (or `--help`) argument:

    sailon -h

Any output from this script is prefixed with `[sailon]`, otherwise all output from your application, errors included, will be echoed out as expected.


## Automatic re-running

sailon was originally written to automate the restarting of your sails app.

## Manual restarting

Whilst sailon is running, if you need to manually restart your application, instead of stopping and restart sailon, you can simply type `rs` with a carriage return, and sailon will restart your process.

## Config files

sailon supports local and global configuration files. These are named `sailon.json` and can be located in the current working directory or in your home directory.


## Monitoring multiple directories

By default sailon monitors the current working directory. If you want to take control of that option, use the `--watch` option to add specific paths:

    sailon --watch app --watch libs app/server.js

Now sailon will only restart if there are changes in the `./app` or `./libs` directory. By default sailon will traverse sub-directories, so there's no need in explicitly including sub-directories.

## Specifying extension watch list

By default, sailon looks for files with the `.js`, `.coffee`, and `.litcoffee` extensions. If you use the `--exec` option and monitor `app.py` sailon will monitor files with the extension of `.py`. However, you can specify your own list with the `-e` (or `--ext`) switch like so:

    sailon -e js,jade

Now sailon will restart on any changes to files in the directory (or subdirectories) with the extensions .js, .jade.

## Ignoring files

By default, sailon will only restart when a `.js` JavaScript file changes. In some cases you will want to ignore some specific files, directories or file patterns, to prevent sailon from prematurely restarting your application.

This can be done via the command line:

    sailon --ignore lib/ --ignore tests/

Or specific files can be ignored:

    sailon --ignore lib/app.js

Patterns can also be ignored (but be sure to quote the arguments):

    sailon --ignore 'lib/*.js'

Note that by default, sailon will ignore the `.git`, `sails_modules`, `bower_components` and `.sass-cache` directories.

## Delaying restarting

In some situations, you may want to wait until a number of files have changed. The timeout before checking for new file changes is 1 second. If you're uploading a number of files and it's taking some number of seconds, this could cause your app to restart multiple times unnecessarily.

To add an extra throttle, or delay restarting, use the `--delay` command:

    sailon --delay 10 server.js

For more precision, milliseconds can be specified.  Either as a float:

    sailon --delay 2.5 server.js

Or using the time specifier (ms):

    sailon --delay 2500ms server.js

The delay figure is number of seconds (or milliseconds, if specified) to delay before restarting. So sailon will only restart your app the given number of seconds after the *last* file change.

<!-- ## Controlling shutdown of your script

sailon sends a kill signal to your application when it sees a file update. If you need to clean up on shutdown inside your script you can capture the kill signal and handle it yourself.

The following example will listen once for the `SIGUSR2` signal (used by sailon to restart), run the clean up process and then kill itself for sailon to continue control:

    process.once('SIGUSR2', function () {
      gracefulShutdown(function () {
        process.kill(process.pid, 'SIGUSR2');
      });
    });

Note that the `process.kill` is *only* called once your shutdown jobs are complete. Hat tip to [Benjie Gillam](http://www.benjiegillam.com/2011/08/sails-js-clean-restart-and-faster-development-with-sailon/) for writing this technique up.

<!-- ## Triggering events when sailon state changes

If you want growl like notifications when sailon restarts or to trigger an action when an event happens, then you can either `require` sailon or simply add event actions to your `sailon.json` file.

For example, to trigger a notification on a Mac when sailon restarts, `sailon.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "events": {
    "restart": "osascript -e 'display notification \"app restarted\" with title \"sailon\"'"
  }
}
```
 -->
<!-- A full list of available events is listed on the [event states wiki](https://github.com/remy/sailon/wiki/Events#states). Note that you can bind to both states and messages.

## Pipe output to somewhere else

```js
sailon({
  script: ...,
  stdout: false // important: this tells sailon not to output to console
}).on('readable', function() { // the `readable` event indicates that data is ready to pick up
  this.stdout.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'));
  this.stderr.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('err.txt'));
});
```
 -->
<!-- ## Using io.js for sailon

If you *only* have io.js installed (and the default install creates a symlink from `sails` to `iojs`), then sailon will work just fine out of the box (or [should](https://github.com/remy/sailon/issues/468)).

If you've got *both* sails and io.js installed, then it's easy! You can either edit the local `sailon.json` file (in your working directory) or in your `$HOME` directory containing:

```json
{
  "execMap": {
    "js": "iojs"
  }
}
```
 -->
<!-- Now you sailon will use [io.js](https://iojs.org/) with JavaScript files instead of sails.

## Using sailon in your gulp workflow

## Using sailon in your Grunt workflow

Check out the [grunt-sailon](https://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-sailon) plugin to integrate sailon with the rest of your project's grunt workflow. -->

<!-- ## Pronunciation

> sailon, is it pronunced: sails-mon, no-demon or sails-e-mon (like pokÃ©mon)?

Well...I've been asked this many times before. I like that I've been asked this before. There's been bets as to which one it actually is.

The answer is simple, but possibly frustrating. I'm not saying (how I pronounce it). It's up to you to call it as you like. All answers are correct :)
